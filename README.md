# WhatsApp Automation

In this project, I am using selenium automation and chrome webdriver object to automate the text entry and click action in the whatsApp query string.
It can be used to send bulk customised messages to list of users

- ## Part 1
> Fetch the list of all data containing the phone numbers and the customised message.(in csv format)

- ## Part 2
> Open the csv data in using python modules and use the data from csv file and send whatsApp messages to each <phone_number> and <customised_message> and click send button.

- ## Part 3
> Generate a report (in csv format) on the base of status of sending each message.
